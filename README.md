Generated through [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) the colour picked in the palette are accessible, bold and work well together. They allow the website user to easily read and understand the writen information. 

These colors have been added to the offical blacks and grey to provide the offical nature of a survey with the color providing the reassurance to the user.
