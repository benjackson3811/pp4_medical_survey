### colour-scheme
![Coolors Colour Scheme](/static/images/readme_images/coolors_color_schema.png)

### Typography

Open Sans: chosen as primary font because its is clear and elegant. The typed letters are easy to read.

Raleway: chosen for headings because it pairs well with the Caveat font.

### Imagery

![stethoscope](/static/images/stethoscope.png)

The Stethoscope picture was taken because it is a common image of going to the doctors. With the forms beneath the image this allows the reader a visual queue of them going to dcotors and getting their details collected.
